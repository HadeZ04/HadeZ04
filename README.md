## 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my corner of GitHub

I'm **Pham Trung Thang** – a curious soul who loves turning wires, code, and a bit of coffee ☕ into smart things that blink, talk, or recognize your face.  

🚀 I tinker with **embedded systems**, **IoT**, and **on-device AI** — from STM32s blinking LEDs to Raspberry Pis that understand your voice or unlock your door 👀.

### 💻 Some things I build for fun (and learning):
- 🔊 Voice-controlled smart home (talk to your room, it listens!)
- 🔐 Face recognition door lock (no keys? no problem!)
- 💡 Music-reactive LED system with STM32 (a.k.a. dancing lights)
- 🧠 AI that finds tumors on X-ray images (cool *and* useful)

---

### 🧠 I love:
- Breaking things (to learn how to fix them) 🔧
- Turning vague ideas into working prototypes ⚙️
- Making code talk to hardware and hardware talk back 🔄

_⚡ Fun fact: My code might be messy, but my LEDs blink in perfect rhythm._ 😄

## 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my corner of GitHub

I'm **Pham Trung Thang**  

🚀 I tinker with **embedded systems**, **IoT**, and **on-device AI**  👀.

### 💻 Some things I built 
- 🔊 Voice-controlled smart home (talk to your room, it listens!)
- 🔐 Face recognition door lock (no keys? no problem!)
- 💡 Music-reactive LED system with STM32 (a.k.a. dancing lights)
- 🧠 AI that finds tumors on X-ray images (cool *and* useful)

---

### 🧠 I love:
- Breaking things (to learn how to fix them) 🔧
- Turning vague ideas into working prototypes ⚙️
- Making code talk to hardware and hardware talk back 🔄
